# 1. Define DevOps

  # ANS
   
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle, improve deployment frequency, and deliver high-quality software reliably. DevOps promotes a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams to achieve continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.

# Core Principles of DevOps

 # ANS
 
- Collaboration: Breaking down silos between teams.
- Automation: Reducing manual processes through tooling.
- Continuous Improvement: Iterating quickly based on feedback.
- Monitoring & Feedback: Ensuring performance and reliability.
- Customer-Centric Action: Prioritizing user satisfaction.

## 2. DevOps Lifecycle Stages

 # ANS
 
A. **Planning**  
   In this stage, teams define requirements and roadmap features based on business goals and user feedback.

B. **Development**  
   Developers write and manage source code using version control tools like Git.

C. **Building**  
   Source code is compiled, dependencies are resolved, and artifacts are created automatically using build tools.

D. **Testing**  
   Automated tests are executed to ensure the code is stable, functional, and free of bugs before deployment.

E. **Release**  
   Approved builds are prepared and tagged for deployment, ensuring proper versioning and documentation.

F. **Deployment**  
   The application is deployed to production or staging environments, often using automated pipelines.

G. **Operations**  
   Infrastructure and environments are managed, often using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or Terraform.

H. **Monitoring**  
   Logs, metrics, and user feedback are analyzed to track performance and detect issues early.
   
>> DevOps is not just a toolset but a mindset focused on delivering value faster and more reliably.
